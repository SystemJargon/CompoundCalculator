<b>What this does:</b>

Based on your inputs, this takes a dollar balance with the added interest rate percentage.

Calculate the balance over years input with compounding interest.

Then subtract if any, tax rate percentage and rate of inflation percentage.

This will then give you a true rate of return.

Note: Inflation and tax rate can be 0% or higher.
